# Galaxy-tab-modified

This repo contains the EA24 linux kernel from opensource.samsung.com with a few additional bug fixes (and possibly new bugs). 
These changes are provided as-is and probably only useful for advanced developers.  For more information see:

https://github.com/humcycles/galaxy-tab-modified/blob/master/Kernel/Documentation/usb/s3c-otg-host.txt

If you make fixes to these changes, please send me a github pull request.
